# The "grunt-devbliss" tasks

## Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `devbliss` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  devbliss: {
      port: 9000,
      testport: 9001,
      livereload: 9002
  },
});
```

## Options

- **port**: port on which the HTTP server is running
- **testport**: port on which the HTTP server used for the tests is running

- `unit-test-dist`: run unit tests on the packaged app
- `e2e-test-app`: run e2e tests on the app
- `e2e-test-dist`: run e2e tests on the packaged app

## Requirements

To be able to use the tasks, your project must have the following structure:

```
my-npm-project
|-- app/                        --> where the application files are (html, js, css)
|   -- bower_components/        --> bower dependencies
|   -- bower_components/ecosystem-main-frontend/ --> main frontend include
|   -- app_components/          --> modules of the app itself
|   -- app_dev_components/  --> development only components
|   -- scripts/                 --> more js scripts
|   -- styles/                  --> css files reside here
|   -- views/                   --> views outside any module
|   -- styles/fonts/            --> where the applications font files are
|   -- styles/less/             --> where the applications less files are
|   -- styles/less/Base.less    --> base less file if less is used
|   -- index.html
|-- test/                       --> application test js files
|-- test/protractor.conf.js     --> protractor configuration file for e2e tests
|-- test/karma.conf.js          --> karma configuration file for unit tests
|-- dist/                       --> where the application is built
|-- Gruntfile.js
|-- package.json
```

To integrate the plugin into your new project please add this to your host projects `package.json`

```
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node_modules/grunt-devbliss/node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update"
  }
```

# Additional config in your host projects Gruntfile.js

The configuration in your Gruntfile.js of your host project will be used as an underlying configuration for most tasks.
This means, that your projects configuration will be merged with the default configuration at runtime.
The default configuration will overwrite your projects configuration on conflict.

There are exceptions to this rule for devbliss-configureRewriteRules, devbliss-configureProxies and devbliss-karma.
For those tasks the configuration of your host project will completely overwrite the default task-related configuration if present.

# Local set up

To work on this plugin locally, use the [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) feature.

# Recreate README.MD

To recreate the README.MD just run `grunt build-contrib`.

# Troubleshooting

- Karma or any other task doesn't work!

```
  >> rm -rf node_modules/grunt-devbliss/node_modules/*
  >> npm install
```

- Karma still doesn't work and there were errors while npm install

  Make sure python27 is installed and selected:

```
  >> sudo port select --set python python27
  >> npm install
```
